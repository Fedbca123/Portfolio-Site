## A site I made to show off some of my project and work experience for people to view.

This site has featuers such as a light and dark mode and the ability to be mobile friendly when viewing through a phone, and all projects name, descriptions, tech used, and github links are all pulled using GitHub's GraphQL API and parsed into a JSON to be read in the frontend.
